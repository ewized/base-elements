This contains styled web components that are used to create websites.
This project is in constant development and things will change around.


## Usage

Please see the wiki to see how to use the components in a web page.
While the Wiki is being created view the source of this [file](https://github.com/ewized/base-elements/blob/master/public/index.html).


## Development

Install the *npm* modules after you have cloned the repo.

> npm install

To run this in a dev environment just use *webpack* to build and watch the `src`.
This folder is used to demo the components as well as develop the components.

> npm run dev

Just serve the `public/` folder from a standard http server, after you ran the command above.
GitHub Pages will host the bundled version for demoing the master branch.
For serving locally use [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb/related?hl=en).
Or you could install `npm install -g serve` and then run `serve public/`.
